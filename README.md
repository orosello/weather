# Tendency Weather Forecaster

This app tries to blend a weather information app with a stock quote app.
The idea is that not only the values are graphed, but also the tendecies for 
each value. The triangles face upward, downward or display a circle depending
on the change. For temperature, a detailed graph is plotted and the maximum 
and minimum temperatures are displayed and their time. If temperature is 
consistently on the rise or on the fall, only that value will show. The color
of the sky changes according to the time of the day. There are a few animations
that match the current weather that aim to augment the reflections on the glass
screen.
